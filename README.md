# Multi-modal deep learning Method:

This problem comes under the category of multi-label classification and product retrieval. Sometimes product's textual data (product title & description) is helpful for this task, and sometimes product's images help. Hence, we need a Deep learning model which takes into account both the products image and text. This is why a multi-modal deep-learning method is required, with its help we can generates such embeddings that comprises of both the product's text and image representation which can help in further downstream tasks for classification and product retrieval.
